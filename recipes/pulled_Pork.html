    <h3>Enticing Pulled Pork Stuff Squash</h3>
    <p>All I could think about when I wrote this was at the end of the 5th Harry Potter movie after Dumbledore and Voldemort’s seriously epic battle, when Fudge comes through the fires, sees Voldemort, and screams, “HE’S BACK!” Like yeah, no sh*t, Fudge. People are disappearing left and right, the dementors have gone rogue and escaped from Azkaban, you have literally gone bat sh*t nuts…we all know you were just too greedy 
        with your own power and didn’t want to admit what was right in front of you.</p>
    <p>That’s kind of what I feel like right now. If you follow me on instagram, you already know I’ve been freaking out about the return of my favorite winter squash: delicata. And yet it’s taken me this long to figure out a recipe I wanted to post with it. Why? Oh, you know. Probably because I’ve been so selfish/greedy that I’ve been hoarding them all to myself/casually forgetting to take pictures of my delicious squash creations before I faceplant into them.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the Ginger-Scallion Sauce</li>
        <li>1 large bunch scallions (about 4 oz)</li>
        <li>1-oz piece of ginger, peeled (about two thumbs) and chopped into ½ inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp coconut aminos</li>
        <li>½ tsp dried garlic</li>
        <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>optional: fresh ground black pepper, to taste*</li>
        <li>½ - ¾ cup avocado oil*</li>
        <li>For the Salmon</li>
        <li>4, 5-6 oz pieces of salmon</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>sea salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Start by making your sauce: Chop the roots off the scallions and wash them so there’s not dirt or grimey pieces on them. Chop into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the ginger and scallions in the food processor and pulse until they’re finely chopped, but not a paste.</li>
        <li>Pull out a large, heatproof bowl. A REALLY large one, bigger than you think you need. Probably the size you would use to toss a salad for about 10 people in. Put the scallions and ginger into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the avocado oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until very hot, but not popping or smoking. Mine took about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour the avocado oil into your large bowl - it’s going to snap, crackle and pop big time, so you may want to step back! This will stop in about a few seconds. Use a wooden spoon to stir. Once the sauce cools for a few minutes, taste and add the coconut aminos, garlic, and a small pinch of salt to taste. Set aside while you make the salmon.</li>
        <li>When the oven is ready, heat a cast iron or other oven-proof skillet on medium-high heat with 1 Tbsp coconut oil for 2 minutes, so it gets really hot.</li>
        <li>Season the salmon on both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon skin side down in the pan and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the salmon out, carefully flip the fillets over, and cook for another minute in the oven. You want the fish to still be slightly pink in the middle - think of cooking a burger to about medium - instead of overcooking it so it’s completely dried out!</li>
        <li>Move the salmon to a plate and test out the middle with a fork - if it flakes easily, it’s done!</li>
    </ol>
