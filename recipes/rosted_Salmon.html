    <h3>Rosted Salmon & Ginger-Scallion Sauce</h3>
    <p>I feel like this is the first semblance of a “real” summer I’ve had since college. Which is AWESOME. But also funny when you think about it because I’ve been working more than most people I know.</p>
    <p>Life ain’t so bad when you’re spending 12-13 hours at the pool every day swimming, coaching, camp counseling, doing swim lessons, and coaching some more. Then throw some more lessons and meets in there. Oh and summer classes for my Nutrition degree. And some health coaching clients. And retaining some a pretty good semblance of a social life, if I do say so myself. Throw in being a bridesmaid in one of my best friend’s weddings in there too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the Ginger-Scallion Sauce</li>
        <li>1 large bunch scallions (about 4 oz)</li>
        <li>1-oz piece of ginger, peeled (about two thumbs) and chopped into ½ inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp coconut aminos</li>
        <li>½ tsp dried garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Start by making your sauce: Chop the roots off the scallions and wash them so there’s not dirt or grimey pieces on them. Chop into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the ginger and scallions in the food processor and pulse until they’re finely chopped, but not a paste.</li>
        <li>Pull out a large, heatproof bowl. A REALLY large one, bigger than you think you need. Probably the size you would use to toss a salad for about 10 people in. Put the scallions and ginger into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the avocado oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until very hot, but not popping or smoking. Mine took about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
